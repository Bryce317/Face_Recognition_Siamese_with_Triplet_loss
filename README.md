# Face_Recognition_Siamese_with_Triplet_loss
Facial Recognition System is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.

I have builded a face recognition model that uses Siamese Networks to give us a distance value that indicates whether 2 images are same or different.
